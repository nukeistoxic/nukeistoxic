WHATS GOOD! I am Nukeistoxic. I make youtube videos. I do void memes, Markdown, Python, JavaScript, etc.
## Q&A
Do you commision?
> Kinda. Ask me for something and how much you offer. If I am intrested, I will help. I am not a very reliable person!

Can I have free stuff?
> No. You can use any of my code I use (if it isn't Markdown or HTML), though. I am a fan of open-source and freeware. Linus is my hero.

Can I work for you?
> Apply whenever I say you can. If you email me or anything about this I will block you.

You arent responding! Can you please respond?
> I don't respond much because I am busy. I also forget. Just have some patience!
